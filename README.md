# Totient Calculator ðŸ”¢

A Python program that calculates **Eulerâ€™s Totient Function (Ï•)** for any positive integer. Great for number theory enthusiasts, students, or anyone exploring modular arithmetic and cryptography basics.

## ðŸ“˜ What Is Eulerâ€™s Totient Function?

Eulerâ€™s Totient Function, denoted Ï•(n), counts the number of positive integers less than or equal to `n` that are relatively prime to `n`. Itâ€™s a key concept in number theory and used in cryptographic algorithms like RSA.

## ðŸš€ How to Use

1. Clone the repo or download the Python file:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/totient-calculator.git
   cd totient-calculator
   ```

2. Run the program:
   ```bash
   python totient_calculator.py
   ```

3. Enter any positive integer when prompted.

The script will compute and display Ï•(n) for your input!

## ðŸ’¡ Example

```text
Enter a number: 9
Ï•(9) = 6
```

## ðŸ›  Features

- Accepts any positive integer
- Calculates totient efficiently using the prime factorization method
- Runs locally in any Python 3 environment
- No external dependencies

## ðŸ¤“ Educational Use

This is a great project for:
- Learning about GCD and coprime numbers
- Understanding the inner workings of RSA encryption
- Practicing efficient number theory algorithms in Python
